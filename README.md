##WALK THROUGH
    1. When the web app loads, the user will be directed to a login page.  If the "admin" logs in, they will be
        directed to a "dashboard" allowing them to access role-specific features (recipe development, scheduling, memos)

    2 .If a "lineCook" user logs in, the will be directed to a dashboard that will allow them to view the digital recipe book,
        access the schedule, and view the kitchen contact list.

    3. A "dishwasher" user will simply have access to the schedule and contact list

    4. For the "generalManager" role, they will be able to access the schedule, contact list, and push notifications to
        the rest of the roles if there is an announcement/memo for the kitchen.
