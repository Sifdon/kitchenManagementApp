### Project Problem Statement and Plan

Hi Adam, you gave a very nice overview of your individual project in class, let's get that same good description into the your readme.md.
 Think of those prospective employers looking at your portfolio and use this as a way to show them what you've built/are going to build.

* You have a good start on the schedule and it shows good level of detail. Just continue with the same technique,
 breaking out the development process into smaller tasks. Some task ideas to get you started: design tables, create tables,
 populate tables with test data, design UI, document application flow, design classes, write weekly blog/wiki/status report, unit tests, logging, etc.

I'm really looking forward to seeing you build this application out. Since this is a topic you know really well, I imagine it will be a lot of fun to create!
